//! The document's input stream for `document.write()`.
//!
//! There is one input stream per document, and the tokenizer carries its state across calls.
//! A construct may therefore be split at any point, even in the middle of a tag name.
//! <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dynamic-markup-insertion.html#dom-document-write>
//!
//! This module inserts nothing itself. It creates the nodes and reports where each belongs,
//! because `Node.appendChild` on the JS side reports the mutation at the same time, registers
//! window named access, and loads a written stylesheet.
