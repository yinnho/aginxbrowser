//! Fork-only: adopt a URL the page routed to itself.
//!
//! A single page app answers a click by calling `history.pushState` and
//! rendering the next view in place. `bootstrap.js` tracks that in
//! `__virtualUrl` so `location.href` reads correctly, but nothing on the Rust
//! side ever looked at it, so the page had moved on while `page.url()` still
//! reported the old document. To a CDP client that is a click that did nothing.
//!
//! Ported from upstream fork commit `d7dca7a` (browser Phase 1 batch 1).
//! Kept out of `page.rs` so an upstream rewrite of that file does not touch
//! it; Rust allows an inherent impl in any module of the defining crate, so
//! the call site still reads `self.sync_virtual_url()`.
